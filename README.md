The vision
==========

A single script, that I execute on an ubuntu server, that prepares the current directory
and connects it with a Git Repo, where the articles are pushed to. As soon an article 
changes, the change becomes visible on a website. 

The Goal
========

To add another website, I only hate to exectue the script. The goal is to spin up a new 
website in under one! minute.
